Hello! Thank you for reviewing my "Wrangle and Analyze Data" project.  This was my 1st project within my Data Wrangling & Data Modeling NANODEGREE.

This project expanded the use of files from different locations.  One was a downloaded csv, another was loaded via URL, and the last was supposed to be a query through X (Twitter) 
for tweets releated to "@WeRateDogs".  Unfortunately, the last one did not work for me as X now requires a subscription for such querys. 

Additonaly, the project required an similar About Me document, Wrangle Report.pdf, and a document that would be similar to a blogpost, ACT Report.pdf.
